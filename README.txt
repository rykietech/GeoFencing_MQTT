In order to run these scripts, the following are required: 

Android Phone,
Windows machine.

For the android phone scripts, flutter is required. Please refer to the following link in order to
install flutter.

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows

$ flutter doctor

from there you may see that you need to unstall android sdk. to do so, please follow this link

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#install-android-studio

Once you have all of this set up you will need to copy the presented scripts into your lib folder

****\flutter_projects\myFlutterApp\lib
(main.dart and home_page.dart located in the flutter_scripts folder).

in the terminal please run the following package retreivals.

$ flutter pub add geolocator
$ flutter pub add geocoding

You will then need to add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml located at android>app>src>main
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />

Add it above the <application> line, directly below the package line.
 
if you have any further issues installing geolocator packages, please refer to this link
https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator/install

$ flutter pub add mqtt_client
if you have any further issues installing mqtt packages, please refer to this link
https://pub.dev/packages/mqtt_client/install

from there, please choose to run the app on a compatible android device as I do not think it will work
using the chrome emulator... it should also work using the regular android emulators but.. whats the point?
you can't move around with that.

To run the mqtt_subscribe scripts, you will need python3 installed.
please refer to the following link to download and install python 3 if needed 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The geolocator packages are required
$ pip install geopandas
or
$ py -m pip install geopandas

please refer to this link if needed https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html

The broker used is the open test broker located at https://test.mosquitto.org/
